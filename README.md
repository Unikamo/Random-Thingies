# Random-Thingies
Random things I'll need on another computer, prob
(Be prepared to meet the most unsafe C code you'll ever see)
((leap years don't work btw))

# Definitions
`math.c` : Get day of the week from a date\
`math.java` : `math.c`, but in Java\
`math.py` : `math.c`, but in Python\
`math.lua` : `math.c`, but in Lua

# Compilation/Use
*file : informations : usage*

+ `math.c` : Only works with GCC with a Linux-Based Distribution (as far as I tested) : `gcc math.c -o math`\
+ `math.java` : Should work everywhere, as long as Java 21+ (preferably with JDK) is installed : `java math.java` or `javac math.java` and `java math`\
+ `math.py` : Should work everywhere, as long as Python 3.12.7+ is installed : `python math.py`\
+ `math.lua` : Should work everywhere, as long as Lua 5.4.7+ is installed : `lua math.lua`
