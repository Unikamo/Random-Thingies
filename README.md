# Random-Thingies
Random things I'll need on another computer, prob
(Be prepared to meet the most unsafe C code you'll ever see)

# Definitions
`math.c` : Get day of the week from a date\
`math.java` : `math.c`, but in Java\
`math.py` : `math.c`, but in Python

# Compilation/Use
`math.c` : Only works with GCC (as far as I tested).\
`math.java` : Should work everywhere, as long as Java 21+ (preferably with JDK) is installed.\
`math.py` : Should work everywhere, as long as Python 3.12.7+ is installed.
